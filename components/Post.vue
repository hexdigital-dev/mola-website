                    DISCOVERING <br>THE BURIAL
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In 2003 archaeologists from
                    <a href="http://www.mola.org.uk">MOLA</a>
                    excavated a small
                    plot of land in Prittlewell, Essex, for
                    <a href="https://www.southend.gov.uk">Southend-on-Sea Borough Council</a>.
                    They were astounded to discover
                    an intact Anglo-Saxon burial chamber.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Careful excavation revealed
                    a collection of rare and precious
                    objects that had been placed within
                    a rectangular timber structure as
                    part of a carefully choreographed
                    burial rite. The artefacts, including
                    an elaborate gold belt buckle
                    made specially for the burial,
                    show this to be the resting
                    place of a man of princely lineage.
                    The crosses over his eyes indicate
                    he was a Christian, a flagon from
                    Syria speaks of his worldly connections,
                    cauldrons and drinking horns suggest a man
                    accustomed to hosting feasts and a musical
                    instrument provides insight into the
                    traditions and pastimes of this
                    lordly figure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chamberâ€™s most impressive items are
                    now on permanent display at Southend
                    Central Museum.
